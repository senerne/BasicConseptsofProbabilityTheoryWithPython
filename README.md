# GEO 225E - Probability and Statistics Assignment

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This repository contains the assignment for the **GEO 225E - Probability and Statistics** course at **Istanbul Technical University**. The project covers fundamental probability concepts, statistical analysis, and visualizations of **Poisson, Normal, and Bivariate Normal distributions** using Python.

## ðŸ“‚ Contents
- **Basic Concepts of Probability Theory**
- **Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDFs)**
  - Derivation and visualization of **CDF of X** with expected value.
  - Derivation and visualization of **CDF of Y** with expected value.
- **Bivariate Normal Distribution**
  - Mathematical operations and sampling using NumPy.
  - Visualization of distributions.

## ðŸ“œ Files Included
- `010220507STA.docx` - Detailed assignment documentation.
- `codes.docx` - Additional documentation explaining the code implementation.
- `HW1.py` - Python script performing all statistical computations and visualizations.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **NumPy** - For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib** - For data visualization.
- **Spyder** - IDE used for coding and debugging.

## ðŸ“Š Implementation Details
- CDF calculations and visualizations were performed using Python.
- Expected values were computed analytically and validated using simulations.
- Bivariate Normal distribution samples were generated using:
  ```python
  np.random.multivariate_normal(mean, cov_matrix, sample_size)
  ```
- Descriptive statistics were computed for the generated data.

## ðŸ“Œ Conclusion
This assignment demonstrates the application of probability and statistics in **Geomatics Engineering**, using Python for both theoretical and computational aspects. The repository contains well-structured scripts and documentation for probability distributions and their real-world applications.
